We believe that our students must be taught how to use online resources responsibly. With parents and guardians as our partners, we can help our students to gain skills, understanding, and mind-sets that will enable them to be responsible and safe in digital environments.

This will be accomplished by the implementation of a comprehensive program that promotes wellness through educational and outreach activities. The program will be facilitated through close collaboration of the wellness coordinator with school counselors, staff, students and parents in the Lambert community.

                As a result of having access and exposure to the resources and support of the Lambert High School Wellness Program, all members of the Lambert community will learn to lead balanced and successful lives of self-awareness and personal growth positively impacting our community, city, state, nation and the world.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">School will never be the same. All new safeguards will need to be installed on how to handle a health crisis or outbreak (from COVID-19 to something else) along with other disasters (natural or otherwise). What was previously inconceivable came fast this year, and has forever changed how we perceive educational centers, but also, I believe how schools will deliver learning to meet the diverse needs of their students. </p>

In 2016, NPR reported the rise of anxiety and mental/emotional issues in students across the United States. With the advent of the pandemic, more than 50 percent of students surveyed reported needing mental health services since the school closures (ACLU of Southern California, 2020). Best Colleges surveyed households with a High School or College student, and more than 44 percent of students reported worried if they can enroll or stay in college (2020). From my perspective, the time has indisputably come to put emotional health and building resilience in every classroom, not just the well-funded ones.</p>

All students and employees must stay home if they have COVID-19 symptoms, tested positive for COVID-19 or had close contact with a person with COVID-19 within the last 14 days. Employees and parents/guardians are asked to self-report to the school nurse. A written physician’s release will be required for return. Quarantined students will have access to their education through itslearning; FCS will not have perfect attendance awards or programs for the school year.</p>
